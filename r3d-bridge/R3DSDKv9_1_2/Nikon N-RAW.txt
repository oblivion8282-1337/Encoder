Nikon N-RAW (.NEV) support was introduced in SDK 9.0.0 and works similar to R3D clips.
The following Nikon cameras support N-RAW recording: Z6 III, Z 8, Z 9 & ZR. 

Most SDK features are supported, including GPU image processing, lower resolution decodes,
most IPP2 decode settings and audio.

N-RAW differences from R3D
-----------------------------------------------
* single .NEV file recorded per clip in the root of the mag
* each clip is consecutively named: DSC_0164.NEV, DSC_0165.NEV, etc.
	* NOTE: unlike R3D, these files are separate clips and should not be treated as a single one!
* always decodes in IPP2 (ColorVersion3, see Clip::MinimumColorVersion() & Clip::DefaultColorVersion() APIs)
* clips can have high-speed playback/project rates of 100 or 120 fps
* timecode:
	* edge/run-record timecode is optional and if missing will default to 01:00:00:00
	* timecode can be drop-frame, i.e.: 01:00:00;00
	* timecode will run at playback/project rate, including 100 or 120 fps (3-digit frame numbers)
* different/higher ISO values may be set per default: 64, 8000, 10000, 16000, 20000 or 25600
	* Nikon ISO 1250 will be mapped to SDK ISO 1280 + small Exposure Adjust setting
* clips can have Auto White Balance and/or Auto Exposure modes, see the section on this below
* RMD_REDCODE metadata is "N-RAW" and RMD_SENSOR_NAME is "NIKON"


SDK features unavailable with N-RAW
-----------------------------------------------
* GPU decode (decompression). GpuDecoder::DecodeSupportedForClip() will return DSUnsupportedClipFormat
* R3D trim & snapshot as well as camera streaming through R3DStream or R3DStream2 APIs
* IPP2 (ColorVersion3) FlashingPixelAdjustment & MasklineAdjust settings
* HDRx, Extended Highlights, Broadcast image processing pipe & IMU track
* RMD_CAMERA_ID, RMD_CAMERA_POSITION, RMD_CLIP_ID, RMD_ORIGINAL_FILENAME, RMD_REEL_ID*'s and frame guide metadata


Auto Exposure (AE)
-----------------------------------------------
If Auto Exposure is enabled when a NEV clip is shot, the recorded ISO metadata will be shown
as 800 and ISO control will work in a relative manner, i.e. setting to ISO 800 will render
the clip as shot, tracking all exposure changes over the length of the clip.

When ISO is set to 1600 the entire clip will render 1 stop brighter than shot, tracking all
exposure changes. Similarly, if the ISO is set to 400, the entire clip will render 1 stop
darker, tracking all exposure changes. In all cases the in-camera exposure changes from the
Auto Exposure will be honored in the rendering.
 
 
Auto White Balance (AWB)
-----------------------------------------------
If Auto White Balance is enabled when a NEV clip is shot, the shot can be rendered in one of
two ways - as shot where the in-camera white balance changes track over the length of the shot,
or the entire shot can be rendered at a set white balance via the usual Kelvin and Tint settings.
 
When an AWB clip is loaded, the metadata values returned for the white balance Kelvin and Tint
represent the first frame of the AWB clip. If the Kelvin and Tint values are not changed, the
clip will render as shot, where the in-camera white balance changes track over the length of
the shot. If the Kelvin and Tint values are changed, the clip will render at those custom values
and not honor the in-camera auto white balance changes.
