  result in a crash by writing too much to the output buffer.
- Fixed a bug where Clip::DecodeVideoFrame() would
  incorrectly use the clip's default ImageProcessingSettings
  when none were supplied for decode. It should use RMD
  settings, if present.
- Fixed a bug where float values in RMD files were
  incorrectly read on platforms where the decimal point
  is a comma.
- Fixed bug where Clip::VideoTrackCount() could crash when
  called on an unopened clip.

- Mac/Win: support for decoding 4.5K clips (introduced with
           RED ONE camera firmware build 21) through the RED
           Rocket path. The RED Rocket scaler is limited to
           2048 pixels wide and thus does not support half
           resolution decode of 4.5K material. Maximum
           supported output size in this case is 2048 x 878
           (if maintaining aspect ratio). Software path does
           support half resolution decode for 4.5K material.
- Mac/Win: RED Rocket 10-bit DPX pixel type added
- Mac/Win: RED Rocket output can be scaled to a custom size
           as well as (center) cropped and letter & pillar
           boxed up to 2048 pixels wide
- Mac/Win: new return code RSOldDriverFirmware if a RED
           Rocket is opened with old drivers or firmware
           installed. The RocketInfo struct has new fields
           to indicate what the minimum versions are the
           SDK requires
- Mac/Win: included RED Rocket 1.0.10.0 installer in the
           support folder
- Mac/Win: new sample code to show custom scale, pad & crop

The 2.3 release contains bug fixes for:
- All: failure to link to the VS2003 libraries (bug was
       introduced in SDK 2.2)
- All: occasional matrix failure using software decode
       (bug was introduced in SDK 2.2)
- Mac/Win: occasional decode failure using RED Rocket
- Mac/Win: occasional slow down when decoding 16-bit at
           4K using RED Rocket
- Mac/Win: RED Rocket could be running at x4 PCI Express
           speed even if it was in a x8 or x16 slot
- Windows: Rocket failure on Core i7 systems



2.2 (August 14, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 2.2 release contains these changes/new features:
- Mac/Win: added more RED Rocket information when opening a
           board or receiving a callback
- Mac/Win: added RED Rocket decode example: 10_RocketDecode.cpp

The 2.2 release contains bug fixes for:
- All: failure to compile due to incorrect header files in
  the 2.1 BETA release
- All: a change introduced in the 2.1 BETA release could
  produce incorrect white balance values for clips recorded
  with camera firmware build 19 or earlier
- All: the CustomPDLogBlackPoint, CustomPDLogGamma and
  CustomPDLogWhitePoint fields in the ImageProcessingSettings
  structure were not initialized to their default settings



2.1 BETA (August 2, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 2.1 BETA release contains these changes/new features:
- Mac/Win: RED Rocket decode support (new header, auto included)
- All: White Balance picker support.
- All: new 8-bit and 16-bit RGB interleaved pixel types
- All: moved metadata to a new header (auto included)
- All: library renamed to R3DSDKv2 (should've been done for
  the beta 2.0 release)

The 2.1 release contains bug fixes for:
- All: decoding clips with the 2.0 BETA SDK recorded with
  camera firmware build 19 or earlier could have incorrect
  clip metadata 



2.0 BETA (June 22, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 2.0 BETA release contains these changes/new features:
- All: color science has been improved significantly and 
  provides for much more accurate color across all the
  colorspaces while also reducing noise in tungsten. This
  new color science syncs up with camera firmware build 20
  but is compatible with older firmware.
  
  

1.6 (May 28, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.6 release contains these changes/new features:
- All: added AudioChannelCount() function to Clip class
- All: added DecodeAudio() & AudioSampleCount() function to
  Clip class as well as new sample code 9_ExtractAudio2.cpp.
  With these new functions a specified number of samples can
  be retrieved from any starting sample position.
- Windows: added 64-bit (x64) Visual Studio 2005 builds.

The 1.6 release contains bug fixes for:
- All: decoding 4K HD clips (recorded with max mode off) at
  16th resolution would actually decode at 240 x 136 instead
  of 240 x 135 and could thus crash an application if the
  supplied buffer was too small. These clips are now
  correctly decoded at 240 x 135.
- All: audio in clips that span more than one R3D file
  could have audio cut outs across file boundaries. This
  could result in shorter and out of sync audio tracks and
  missing samples throughout an audio track.



1.5 (April 8, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.5 release contains bug fixes for:
- Windows: under certain scenarios clip resolution,
  framerate & original clip filename were incorrect which
  could result in decode failures
- Windows: decoding a clip while loading other clips at the
  same time could result in either of the two failing
- Linux: unable to link with the PIC libraries


1.4 (March 20, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.4 release contains these changes/new features:
- changed decode mode FOURCC's to their respective values
  to reduce compilation warnings on Linux
- change Mac OS and Linux library name from 'R3DSDKv1.a' to
  'libR3DSDKv1.a' to be more compatible on these platforms
- added 685, 985 & custom PDlog gamma curve options,
  including new fields in the ImageProcessingLimits struct
- added 16th resolution decode option
- reduced memory consumption on Vista when lots of clips
  are loaded (or a clip with many R3D files)
- changed DRX default setting to off (0.0), switching it
  to on (any value above 0.0) has a slight performance
  impact, also see DRX bugfix below
- added LSNotInitialized failure code to indicate the
  library was not initialized properly (constructors did
  not run). This can happen in Objective-C when the class
  is part of an Objective-C class. Use 'new' instead.
- added RMD_ORIGINAL_FILENAME metadata item to get the
  original camera filename for the first R3D file in the
  clip currently loaded
- added Windows builds that are linked to the debug CRT
- added Linux 64-bit build
- added position independent (fPIC) Linux builds

The 1.4 release contains bug fixes for:
- crash with certain user curve settings
- occasional hang during process unload fix #2
- half and full resolution debayer created a visible border
- link problems solved for Mac OS X builds
- certain Kelvin & Tint combinations produced invalid
  results, these are now clamped to valid values. There
  is no API or parameter range change.
- DRX wasn't doing anything
- BytesPerRow aligntment wasn't enforced properly


1.3 (January 28, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.3 release contains these new features:
- 32-bit Linux support
- access to the raw audio data, see new sample 8 on how to
  extract the audio. Sample 2 updated to display audio info

The 1.3 release contains bug fixes for:
- occasional hangs during process unload
- occasional crash during unload
- fixed a bug were delete was used instead of free()
- fixed problem where DECODE_HALF_RES_GOOD was actually
  DECODE_HALF_RES_PREMIUM. The DECODE_HALF_RES_GOOD is
  now significantly faster than it was before!
- fixed documentation bug that said the 'detail' setting
  was available for DECODE_HALF_RES_PREMIUM which it is not!
- fixed another problem where too much memory was being
  allocated


1.2 (October 24, 2008)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.2 release contains bug fixes for:
- fixed one of the problems where too much memory was being
  allocated on full and half resolution decodes. In these
  situations about 15% less memory is being used now
- fixed race condition which could lead to corrupt images
- fixed bug introduced in SDK v1.1 which caused decode of
  4096 x 2048 files to fail, producing corrupt images
- fixed bug introduced in SDK v1.1 where the Mac internal
  version of the SDK was set to v1.0 instead of v1.2


1.1 (September 24, 2008)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1.1 release contains bug fixes for:
- link problems on the Mac version
- memory leaks
- occasional crashing


1.0 (August 26, 2008)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- initial release
